I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Zurich](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en.html) and affiliated researcher at the [Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/). My primary research interests lie at the intersection of Development Economics, Political Economy, and Cultural Economics. I study how culture and social networks affect economic development and vice verse, using novel longitudinal data sets and innovative empirical methods -- including machine learning and natural language processing.

I am particularly interested in the application of research in cultural evolution to public policy and the private sector.

You can find a pdf version of my [C.V. here](static/files/cv.pdf).

My research has benefited from generous support from the following organizations:

* [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/)
* [Swiss Study Foundation](https://www.studyfoundation.ch/)
